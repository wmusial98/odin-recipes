    <p>This is one of my favorite cookies of all time, although technically they're closer to a pie than a cookie. 
    Nothing prepares you for that intense, awesome sweet-tart lemon flavor and custard, perfectly contrasted against 
    that crisp, sweet buttery shortbread cookie. <em>- Chef John, Food Wishes</em></p>
